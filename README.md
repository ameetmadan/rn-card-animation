# React Native "Tinder-like" Card Animation

This is from a course by Stephen Grider on Udemy, but I decided to make it available here for usage in any React Native app.

I will try to summarize the content of the course here so that you know exactly what variables to change when adding this to your app.

## App.tsx

- `renderCard()`: Using [react-native-elements]() Card, I created the basic card element and passed the values using `const data = []`. This can be modified by adding an API to it so that it is more useful.

- `renderNoMoreCards()`: Here I handle what happens when the last card is swiped. You could add a button here and then using a function get more data from your API.

## Deck.tsx
